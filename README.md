domianCheckScript


in linux

use ./start.sh to start the domainCheck Script
use pwhois can solve the cpu too high problem!

belown is old wiki:
use ./file to produce the domain list
and use ./start.sh to check the domain regit status
finally you can look the log to get the unregit domain

you must have install jwhois before your use ./start.sh to make the list

it will cause the cpu to 100%,this is the jwhois bug in centos,but seems it had fixed in Fedora and other linux.
if you have the better solutions.expect your advises.
